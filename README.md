• Analyzed 300,000 domestic flights in India over the span of 50 days to determine which airlines dominated the airline industry based on total ticket sales and total revenue using Tableau

• Designed concise data visualizations (boxplots, histograms, geographical map, etc.) to analyze the distribution of flight prices across all airlines based on different arrival and departure times

• Built a compelling insight-driven narrative to communicate our findings effectively and reduce complexity using Tableau Story.
